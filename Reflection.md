This activity was filled with different functions from the tidyverse packages. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was storing everything that we did previously.
I didnt think it was going to be a big deal at first, but knowing that a modification of column x has to be stored as column x of a matrix was important. I am getting
a grasp on that portion of the coding. I also learned the importance of being able to know where to look on the internet for answers to your questions, and 
learning from already published sources. This will definitely come in handy. The biggest challenge I am facing is just solidifying all of this stuff, but I think
that will come with time.
